## Coding Challenge

The idea of this is to challenge candidates’ abilities to understand and engage with interviewers to complete the task. The challenge covers core functionality  which we use daily at Patchwork, including working with API’s, building reusable methods, displaying understanding of good design patterns, and the testing thereof. 

There is a public API which allows users to retrieve specific cryptocurrency details which can be found at   [https://api.nomics.com](https://api.nomics.com/v1/)  (please acquire your own API key for the challenge) . 

With access to the API, we require the user to present the following information.

### Requirement 1
Retrieve a list of cryptocurrencies given set of tickers (symbols)

Ie: Given an array of `[‘BTC’, ‘XRP’, ‘ETH’]`
I want to get the full payload of those cryptocurrencies

### Requirement 2
Retrieve a (list) specific crypto currency and specific values based on the ticker and any other dynamic params

Ie: We want to view the `[circulating_supply, max_supply, name, symbol, price]` for `[ETH, BTC]`

### Requirement 3
Retrieve a specific cryptocurrency to specific fiat. Ie: BTC in ZAR or ETH in USD

### Requirement 4
Calculate the price of one cryptocurrency from another, in relation to their dollar value

Ie:  1BTC = $100, 1ETH = $50, therefore 1ETH == 0.5BTC
